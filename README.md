# Facial_Keypoint_Detection
Facial keypoint detection system that takes in any image with faces, and predicts the location of keypoints on each face.
This project is about defining and training a convolutional neural network to perform facial keypoint detection, and using computer vision techniques to transform images of faces. 
The project is broken up into a few main parts in four Python notebooks:

Notebook 1 : Loading and Visualizing the Facial Keypoint Data

Notebook 2 : Defining and Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to Predict Facial Keypoints

Notebook 3 : Facial Keypoint Detection Using Haar Cascades and your Trained CNN

Notebook 4 : Fun Filters and Keypoint Uses
